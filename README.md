# ruby-algorithms
Various popular algorithms implemented in Ruby

# Dynamic
These algorithms take the approach of solving the problem by splitting it into sub-problems and solving each sub-problem then storing its solution for a later final calculation resulting in the answer; this can simplify complex problems and reduce computation time... 
 - Fibonacci
 - Longest common subsequence
 - Longest increasing subsequence?
 - Ugly Numbers?
 - Binomial Coefficient?
 - Permutation Coefficient?

# Graph Traversal
These algorithms focus on visiting each node of the graph, sometimes multiple times when cycles are present, and possibly running another algorithm on the value of each node. 
 - Depth-First Search
 - Breadth-First Search
 - Dijkstra (Shortest path from source to ever v)
 - Floyd Warshall (Shortest path from every v to every other v)?
 - Union Find (Detect a cycle)
 - Kruskal (Minimum spanning tree)
 - Prim (Minimum spanning tree)

# Hashing
These algorithms describe how a hash function will be used and how a message will be transformed using the hash function.r
 - Message Digest (MD5)
 - Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA)
 - RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest (RIPEMD)
 - Whirlpool
 - Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)

# Search
These algorithms are used to find an element in any type of data structure; when the data is sorted binary search is standard, otherwise linear search is used.
 - Linear
 - Binary

# Sort
These algorithms organize elements in any data structure into a specific ordering; while accomplishing the same goal each algorithm can approach the task differently and perform at various speeds.
 - Bubble
 - Insertion
 - Selection
 - Merge
 - Quick
 - Heap?


# Tree Traversal
These algorithms focus on visiting each node of the tree and possibly running another algorithm on the value of each node.
 - Pre-order traversal
 - Post-order traversal
 - In-order traversal
 - Minimum depth in binary tree
 - Check if binary tree is a full binary tree or not?
